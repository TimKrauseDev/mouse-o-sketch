This sorting visualizer is a front-end application that allows users to visualize the following sorting algorithms: Bubble, Insertion, Merge, Quick and Selection. You have the ability to sort the array of bars automatically or step-by-step. This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and deployed to [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/).
